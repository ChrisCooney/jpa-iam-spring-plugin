# SHIRP - Spring Hibernate IAM RDS Plugin

SHIRP is a plugin to enable the simple authentication of spring applications, leveraging IAM roles from within AWS
instead of storing database passwords somewhere in the application configuration. This library is designed for applications
that are running with AWS architecture and, thus, can rely on the instance profile of their machine to determine their
access rights into the database.

I called it **SHIRP** because I didn't want to have to keep typing _Spring Hibernate IAM RDS Plugin_
